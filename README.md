   Hi, I’m @Izedinoumer
   I’m interested in ... Hardware design
   I’m currently learning ... Electrical and computer engineering


I am using this platform as a way to showcase the past codes I've written from school or personal projects
Most of the codes here will be coded from the C variant software used in arduinos.
